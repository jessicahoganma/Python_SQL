# Python_SQL
This notebook uses the MySQL Connector and Python to implement a database on MySQL Server, and to create, read, update and delete data in that database.
## About
The notebook takes the reader step-by-step through all the processes involved with using Python and the MySQL Connector to perform the standard CRUD functions on a database running on MySQL Server.

I implemented the same code to build the below database using data from [this](https://github.com/jessicahoganma/SQL_hospital_Project) previous project, but this time I did it doing it via Python using MySQL Connector.
